Welcome to CSC369 Assignment 1!
This assignment is designed to help you review the C programming skills and memory management techniques, which are essentials for the rest of the course. 
Please read through the comments in ALL source files. 
DO NOT edit headers (queue.h, stack.h, defines.h) as you will only submit queue.c and stack.c.
Test your code before submission! We will use the same tests to test your code as you have!
Good luck and Enjoy!
